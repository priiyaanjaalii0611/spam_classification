# Email spam_classification using R script ðŸ“Ÿ


The model is trained using ML algorithm in R Language using **Naive Bayes Classification Algorithm**
<br>
Data preprocessing consists <br>
* Cleaning and organising data
* Selecting features important for the classification
* Handling Missing data
* Handling unreadable codes which are basically images in email body converted in csv file
* The code also uses **Natural language Processing** to deal with email content

## Data
Data is "19bds0111.csv" which consists of 200 mails,<br> (I know the dataset is small cause I manually made it, If the model is trained on a bigger dataset the accuracy achieved will be higher)

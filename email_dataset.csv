17d4a35daa5a8086,hello@lifehack.org,Simon Lee,utaku0611@gmail.com,utaku0611@gmail.com,People are just not reading anymore ...,"Nov 23, 2021, 05:35:45","Nov 23, 2021, 06:03:03","
People are just not reading as they used to ...
Don't believe me?
Tell me if this has ever happened to you.
You set yourself a reading goal.
You tell yourself you're going to start reading 30 minutes per day.
But as soon as you sit down and open your book.
Boom.
A notification pops on your phone.
A new friend who just got married posted his wedding photos on IG.
You want to get focused on your book but...
You just can't.
The curiosity is just too much to bear.
So you put your book down, telling yourself it will only be a moment.
That you'll get a quick glance at the post and go straight into reading.
Last thing you know...
Three hours passed.
You've been mindlessly scrolling through your news feed.
And you didn't read a single chapter of your book.
Again.
Believe it or not...
This is something most people struggle with...
Actually...
81% of Americans say they don't read as much as they'd like to.
I went through something like that a couple of years ago.
See ...
I've always been a fan of reading.
But a couple of years ago in New Year's...
I decided to take some time off.
That year, I had achieved some pretty ambitious goals for myself.
So, I wanted to give up on my habit of reading every day.
I literally didn't open a single book for the entire year ...
I honestly didn't think it would have such an impact on my life.
But it did.
The year before I stopped reading, I had been seeing my life improve in every
area.
I had just been reading two books per month.
I felt great.
New ideas coming my way every day.
Like if every book I read inspired me to try something new in my business and my
personal life.
But that year when I quit on my habit...
Nada.
I barely made any progress.
I felt stuck.
Depressed.
Like I wasn't doing anything useful with my time.
Even my business stopped growing that year as a result.
When I realized this, I decided to go back to my reading habit.
I remember thinking to myself...
Ok, this shouldn't be that hard to get into.
I mean, I used to read every single day.
How hard could it be to get into that habit once again?
But it wasn't.
It was really hard to stay consistent with it.
I just couldn't do it on my own.
That's what I want out about something that actually made a difference.
And allowed me to get that habit back.
You know what it was?
Joining a reading challenge.
That's what made a difference.
In case you're not familiar with them.
A reading challenge is when a group of people set a certain reading goal over a
period of time.
The goal can be related to several books; a set of themes, genres, or types of
books to read; or even how often you read about.
Many readers take on a challenge because it’s a fun way to add variety to their
reading and ensure they read diverse books and authors.
In my opinion, these challenges are the best way to develop your reading habits.
Why?
Two reasons.
First, because it forces you to stay consistent.
Studies have shown that it takes approximately 21 days to form a habit and turn
a behavior into automatic.
And second, because of the community aspect.
Usually, there are big communities around these challenges.
So if at any moment you start getting bored or want to quit...
You'll have a community behind you to support you and motivate you to keep
moving forward.
Plus, you'll get a chance to meet new people, share your opinions, and have
interesting discussions about the topic the book is about.
I just knew joining a challenge like this will help me build my reading habit
back up...
And so I did.
Now, I'm not going to lie to you [First Name] and tell you about how easy it
was...
How joining a challenge immediately got me on the right track.
Oh no.
It was hard at first.
After all, it had been quite a while since I read anything, to be honest...
But after a few weeks, the changes started to notice.
Reading every day became less of a burden.
And if I ever needed motivation or felt like I wanted to quit...
The challenge community was there to cheer me up.
We were there to support each other.
Like we were all in this together.
At the end of the year, I was an entirely different person.
All because I had read tons of books on different topics.
And not only in business.
Finance.
Wellness.
Mindset.
Every area of my life grew.
I know now taking that challenge was one of the best decisions I've made.
And I'm sure it will do the same for you.
Always forward.
Simon
P.S. If you want to learn how to make the time to build habits that change your
life for the better then...

17d47e0e89beba20,hello@lifehack.org,Simon Lee,utaku0611@gmail.com,utaku0611@gmail.com,81% of Americans say this ...,"Nov 22, 2021, 18:55:07","Nov 22, 2021, 19:11:01","
People are just not reading as they used to ...
Don't believe me?
Tell me if this has ever happened to you.
You set yourself a reading goal.
You tell yourself you're going to start reading 30 minutes per day.
But as soon as you sit down and open your book.
Boom.
A notification pops on your phone.
A new friend who just got married posted his wedding photos on IG.
You want to get focused on your book but...
You just can't.
The curiosity is just too much to bear.
So you put your book down, telling yourself it will only be a moment.
That you'll get a quick glance at the post and go straight into reading.
Last thing you know...
Three hours passed.
You've been mindlessly scrolling through your news feed.
And you didn't read a single chapter of your book.
Again.
Believe it or not...
This is something most people struggle with...
Actually...
81% of Americans say they don't read as much as they'd like to.
I went through something like that a couple of years ago.
See ...
I've always been a fan of reading.
But a couple of years ago in New Year's...
I decided to take some time off.
That year, I had achieved some pretty ambitious goals for myself.
So, I wanted to give up on my habit of reading every day.
I literally didn't open a single book for the entire year ...
I honestly didn't think it would have such an impact on my life.
But it did.
The year before I stopped reading, I had been seeing my life improve in every
area.
I had just been reading two books per month.
I felt great.
New ideas coming my way every day.
Like if every book I read inspired me to try something new in my business and my
personal life.
But that year when I quit on my habit...
Nada.
I barely made any progress.
I felt stuck.
Depressed.
Like I wasn't doing anything useful with my time.
Even my business stopped growing that year as a result.
When I realized this, I decided to go back to my reading habit.
I remember thinking to myself...
Ok, this shouldn't be that hard to get into.
I mean, I used to read every single day.
How hard could it be to get into that habit once again?
But it wasn't.
It was really hard to stay consistent with it.
I just couldn't do it on my own.
That's what I want out about something that actually made a difference.
And allowed me to get that habit back.
You know what it was?
Joining a reading challenge.
That's what made a difference.
In case you're not familiar with them.
A reading challenge is when a group of people set a certain reading goal over a
period of time.
The goal can be related to several books; a set of themes, genres, or types of
books to read; or even how often you read about.
Many readers take on a challenge because it’s a fun way to add variety to their
reading and ensure they read diverse books and authors.
In my opinion, these challenges are the best way to develop your reading habits.
Why?
Two reasons.
First, because it forces you to stay consistent.
Studies have shown that it takes approximately 21 days to form a habit and turn
a behavior into automatic.
And second, because of the community aspect.
Usually, there are big communities around these challenges.
So if at any moment you start getting bored or want to quit...
You'll have a community behind you to support you and motivate you to keep
moving forward.
Plus, you'll get a chance to meet new people, share your opinions, and have
interesting discussions about the topic the book is about.
I just knew joining a challenge like this will help me build my reading habit
back up...
And so I did.
Now, I'm not going to lie to you [First Name] and tell you about how easy it
was...
How joining a challenge immediately got me on the right track.
Oh no.
It was hard at first.
After all, it had been quite a while since I read anything, to be honest...
But after a few weeks, the changes started to notice.
Reading every day became less of a burden.
And if I ever needed motivation or felt like I wanted to quit...
The challenge community was there to cheer me up.
We were there to support each other.
Like we were all in this together.
At the end of the year, I was an entirely different person.
All because I had read tons of books on different topics.
And not only in business.
Finance.
Wellness.
Mindset.
Every area of my life grew.
I know now taking that challenge was one of the best decisions I've made.
And I'm sure it will do the same for you.
Always forward.
Simon

life for the better then...

17d385e8e6575895,hello@lifehack.org,Simon Lee,utaku0611@gmail.com,utaku0611@gmail.com,Are you just hoping for the best ?,"Nov 19, 2021, 18:34:31","Nov 19, 2021, 18:54:21","
Imagine this ...
You go on a trip.
But you don't know absolutely anything about the place you're going to.
You don't know what places you'll visit there.
You don't know what your budget is.
You don't even have a hotel reservation!
Just wait until you get there to find a place to stay.
Now let's apply this example in our daily lives.
Life is a journey.
The most important of all in fact.
And all of us have goals we want to accomplish in life.
Maybe you want to lose some weight.
Or a really big goal, like starting a successful six-figure business.
Maybe you're clear about your destination (objective).
But...
Do you know what steps you need to follow to get there?
Or are you just seeing the days go by and hoping for the best?
Just figuring things out as you go.
And not taking the time to think for a moment.
To consider what's the best strategy based on your goal.
Sounds like a formula for disaster, doesn't it?
It is.
These types of actions cannot end well.
In fact, the only result you can get out of them is one...
Wasted time and money.
Time that you'll never get back.
And the money it cost you so hard to get.
I don't think anyone would want this.
And if you don't want this to happen to you...
You need to stop improvising on your goals.
Instead...
Start gathering your ideas and transforming them into actual projects.
Do you want to know how to do it?
Then keep on reading.
First, go to your favorite place.
Somewhere where you can relax, dream and hatch your idea.
It could be anywhere.
The main idea here is to go to a place where you can feel at home.
With the least possible distractions.
And start imagining what you want to achieve in your life.
And the ways you can make that happen.
As soon as you start thinking through this, ideas will start coming to you.
So have a notebook handy and write them all down.
Second,
When you're writing down your ideas.
It can be tempting to organize them and make sure each one of them makes sense.
Don't.
Taking the time to make sure they're well organized right away can slow you
down.
So just let your brain flow and write everything that comes to mind.
Even if it doesn't make sense at first.
Later when the brainstorming session is over, you can take the time to organize
what you wrote.
Third, your ideas must be easily accessible.
It's great to have all your ideas written down.
But having them written in different places or formats can become a problem
really fast.
So, keep your notes and ideas in one place.
This can be a separate notebook.
Or if you're more into digital, there are many great apps you can use to keep
and store your notes.
I recommend you use Evernote for this.
Also, reviewing your notes can be a great way to remember them.
Maybe even inspiring you with more and better ideas.
Now that you have all of your ideas in one place...
It's time to organize them in a way that is useful and easy to understand.
A quick and easy way to organize your ideas is to categorize them.
You may have noticed that some of your ideas are linked or related.
Consider what links them, and create a category for it.
If you have a lot of ideas, you could even make subcategories.
Fifth, take action!
Listen ...
You can have the best ideas in the world.
But if you don't do something about them, then nothing will happen.
You have to start making your ideas come true.
Start taking action on them.
A great way to do this is to take each idea you have and ask yourself the
following questions:
How can I make this relevant to my daily life?
What ideas would be most beneficial to take action today and why?
Is there a common pattern here? And if If so, how could you combine these ideas
to make them more powerful?
These questions will help you determine which idea is the most viable.
Also, which idea you can start working on right now.
Put all these tips into practice, and you'll take full advantage of your ideas.
Your productivity will dramatically increase.
And you'll achieve every goal you set for yourself.
Guaranteed.
Remember ,
Having a clear mind, organized ideas, and a strategy...
It will always be the best option to avoid failure.
It gives you a clear picture of where you're at in life.
And what things you need to change to get to where you want to be.
Your friend,
Lion.

projects...

,
Have you ever been in a situation where you feel you could've done more?
Where you could have taken a step forward and taken action but...
You didn't?
We've all been there at least once in our lives.
After all, most of us get turned off by risks.
For them, it's more comfortable to just sit down and do nothing.
Just staying within their comfort zone.
The problem with that time goes by.
And people end up wishing they had done things differently.
Lived different lives.
Many of them have unresolved relationship issues.
Unfulfilled dreams.
And long-held resentments.
Always wondering.
What if I just would've...?
That's when they start feeling depressed.
Guilty.
And filled with regret.
Knowing that they could've chosen to do more.
To take that first step and do things differently.
Or think things through a little bit more but...
They didn't.
And that's when guilt comes knocking on their door.
Like an uninvited guest who's not welcomed.
And he doesn't go away easily.
It stays for months.
Years.
Even decades sometimes.
On the other hand...
Risk-takers are more likely to be successful.
Let me explain why.
Every risk you take lits a fire within you.
A burning desire to keep going and reach the finish line.
That's why oftentimes, only the adventurous kind of people are the ones who take
risks.
They have this passion to reach new heights.
And that same passion empowers them to be more creative and prepared to win in
life.
These people are bold.
Courageous.
And with that courage also comes confidence and alertness.
Even when everyone around them chooses to quit.
They stay in.
And that makes them great leaders.
They're always gaining knowledge.
Always prepared for whatever new challenge may arise.
And that's vital to their success.
Risk takers are able to identify such knowledge because they are willing to go
through the process to get it.
And that gives them the skill to overcome any challenge and always know where to
go next.
Risk takers know that success won't fall in your lap.
You have to chase it.
That's why they take risks in the first place.
They are shooting for the sky amidst the storm.
And it's through that chase ...
That they find seemingly rare opportunities that others have never seen before.
Risk takers are active.
And ready to go after their success.
And the more risk you take...
That's when you become unstoppable.
Because taking risks has strengthened your will to keep on going no matter what.
Fear is a mental block that stops many from achieving their dreams and becoming
successful.
But risk-takers go over that fear.
That's what differentiates the doers from the dreamers.
While the dreamers keep on sleeping and waiting for the best moment to take
action...
The risk-takers are moving forward and reaping the rewards.
They're are more likely to be successful because they do not limit themselves.
And are willing to give in their all when others have doubts.
And in the long run, this path will inevitably take you to one destination.
Success.
Accomplished dreams.
Achieved goals.
No more regret.
No more guilt.
You will be free.
Your past will no longer torment you.
See ,
We can all go through the same circumstances.
Face the same challenges.
But, most people won't dare to move forward and take risks.
Our attitude is what makes the difference.

Keep moving forward.

Simon

17d2e1492809ba6e,hello@lifehack.org,Leon Ho,utaku0611@gmail.com,utaku0611@gmail.com,We've always been told this ...,"Nov 17, 2021, 18:37:06","Nov 17, 2021, 18:57:20","
You know ...
There's one lie we've been told throughout our whole lives.
You know what that lie is?
That working hard is the path to success.
It's literally what every motivational speaker and success guru is saying on
social media right now...
Especially these days where the year is coming to end.
Coaches tell you that you must work 100-hour weeks.
Grind every single minute you have off.
Outwork your competition.
If you want to make your dreams come true and achieve your goals...
Hustle is the day.
And what does a family man does when they hear that?
They start giving their 110% at work.
Spending sleepless nights on projects.
They become the first person to arrive at the office and the last one who
leaves.
Putting overtime hours because they think their boss will notice.
After all, that's the way to succeed in the corporative world.
When you ask them about their jobs, they'll tell you something like...
Yeah, I was sick but... I still showed up There are things to be done and no
time to waste.
All with the hopes that one day they'll start climbing the corporate ladder.
They're tearing themselves apart.
And wearing the scars like a badge of honor or something like that.
Until they start seeing the consequences.
Their 9-to-5's end up consuming them.
Every other area in their life starts falling apart.
Their relationships with their families start deteriorating.
Their children barely see them, because they're always at the office.
There's never time to get a coffee with a friend because they're always working.
There's not enough time to go to the gym...
So their health starts deteriorating.
And eventually, they end up losing everything...
... just because ""that's the price you need to pay"".
Maybe you just can't settle with that...
Maybe you want something better.
Well ...
I'm here to tell you there's another way.
But you need to change your approach.
As of today..
.
You need to stop looking at the hours you spend on doing something.
And start focusing on the results you get instead.
Let's face it .
If hard work was the key to success...
Then every construction worker, firefighter, or farmer in the US would be a
millionaire.
But they're not.
In fact, they're one of the most underpaid professions in the world.
All whilst an architect is paid millions for drawing some things out on a piece
of paper.
I know they're giving their all.
That these people are passionate about helping others.
But at the end of the day...
Your success is directly linked to the results you get.
To the value, you can bring over time.
The number of hours you spend doing something doesn't matter.
Your company doesn't care if you work overnight hours.
It doesn't matter how many hours you spend crafting the perfect marketing
strategy...
If you have no results, it will all be for nothing.
So instead of trying to find ways to work 10-hours straight...
Focus on getting the skills that add the most value to your company or your
customers.
Those that are not bound by time.
And actually make a difference.
Once you start doing that ...
You'll become a part of a select group of people.
Those that can charge thousands of dollars for work that takes them 10 minutes.
You'll know what's like to have all the time in the world in your hands.
No more spending sleepless nights to get the results.
No more 100-hour workweeks.
You'll be able to get more results than ever before.
Twice as fast.
And what's most important.
You'll be able to take care of the things that matter the most.
Your friend,
Leon
P.S. If you want to learn how to acquire the skills you need to succeed in life
and get things done faster then...
I can help you get there

So ...
Just the other day I was going through my emails when...
I got a message from a hater.
Even though I get tons of emails from people thanking me for all the value I
give on my daily newsletter.
I get one of these from time to time.
From people that prefer spending their time hanging out on Reddit forums than
taking action and changing their lives...
Anyhow...
This person blasted me with hate comments about why the online education
industry was worthless.
Now, I'm not going to put the email here.
(It was quite offensive to be with)
What I am going to do though is this...
I will clarify two of the biggest claims this person did to me.
Just because I feel that might be stopping you as well from taking action and
becoming the person you want to be.
Just to warn you...
Some of them might be a little uncomfortable to hear...
Especially in these days where you can Google your way out of pretty much
anything.
So, here's the first one...
Why would I have to pay for online education when there's so much free stuff
online these days?
And I mean...
I get where this person was coming from.
This person was probably just venting their frustration.
Maybe they're money buying an online course with hyped-up promises.
And in the end, they didn't get the results they waiting for.
Now, just to clarify...
This IS something you can do.
With a lot of hard work and effort, you can learn everything an online program
has to offer for FREE.
But think about it.
Do you really have the time to do this?
Can you afford to spend hundreds of hours going through online articles and
watching YouTube videos?
Just failing your way to success and figuring things out on your own?
I'd dare to say no.
You need results TODAY.
To find the shortest path between where you're at right now in life...
...and that action-taker who makes things happen and has the skills to succeed
in life.
If you don't want to spend all your time in that...
Why don't we change that belief for a new one?
One that doesn't involve trying to make sense of an endless list of article
links and YouTube videos?
And instead, start believing that...
👉 You don't need to get overwhelmed with blog articles that contradict each
other to learn a new skill.
👉 You don't have to read the 3,840,000,000 results you get from a single Google
search to become the person you want to be.
👉 You don't have to stop spending time with your kids to master the skills that
will transform your life and help you succeed.
Please remember.
The people who are getting things done, achieving their goals, and becoming
their best version...
Didn't get there by complaining about Facebook groups.
They do not spend their time leaving offensive comments on YouTube.
Instead, they were wise enough to understand they couldn't figure this thing out
by themselves.
To realize their minds were their most important asset.
And if they wanted to move forward faster.
They needed to follow the advice of experts and learn from the mistakes of
others.
Hopefully, you'll do that from now on.
Now, there's an even worse belief that has spread lately.
I'll tell you more about that one tomorrow.
Until then.
Your friend,
Leon

...
You know why most people don't take action and never go for what they want in
life?
Because of the ""I can't"".
Whenever it's time for them to make a life-changing decision, the only answer
they have is...
I can't.
Why don't you learn a new skill?
I can't. I don't have time.
Start your own business?
I can't, I don't have money.
It's the only thing they know how to say.
Truth is, they're just too afraid of what might happen.
They usually don't have their skills.
They worry that they're not up to the challenge.
That stress will end up conquering them and making them fail.
So they prefer to do nothing.
And decide to settle for what they have right now.
To stay average.
Looking at how others do get successful and achieve their goals.
But never feeling it themselves.
And feeling horrible about it.
With a bitter taste in the mouth.
For not daring to take the step, regardless of the consequences.
Because they allowed their fears to stop them from pursuing their dreams and
going after what they really want in life.
Without realizing it, they killed all the dreams and aspirations they ever had.
What these people end up discovering later is that they end up living with a
load on their shoulders.
A load of regret.
And it gets worse as time goes on.
You always end up remembering that moment when you had the opportunity to change
your life ...
But you chose not to.
But you know what ?
The fact that you are reading this email tells me that you still have time.
Perhaps you are facing that life-changing decision right now.
But you haven't made that leap because you think you can't.
If that's the case then...
Let me tell you something.
There's one key thing that differentiates successful people from the average.
And that is that...
Successful people never say ""I can't.""
Instead, they ask: ""How can I do it?""
Successful people are willing to do whatever it takes to be successful.
If they fail, they learn from that experience and move on.
Most people don't do that.
They stay in their comfort zone.
Because they're too afraid to fail.
And you can't expect different results if you keep doing the same things over
and over again.
That's why you need to step up and start trying new approaches.
Think of a time when you had to do something you were really scared of...
Something that you were really afraid of.
Maybe giving a speech in front of an audience, or asking someone out on a date.
Now tell me, after you did it...
Did it feel as scary?
In the end, it wasn't as scary and difficult as you thought, was it?
And you learned from that experience.
Start approaching everything in your life in the same way.
If you really want to be successful, you must take action.
Find a way to approach the situation.
Organize your schedule and find the time you need to practice.
Break down your goal into smaller goals.
Sure, it will take longer to get to where you want...
But at least you'll start moving forward.
And once you start changing the ""I can't"" by ""how can I do it?""...
Everything will change for you.
You'll start seeing new windows of opportunity in your life.
And your mind will start finding ways to make them a reality.
Eventually, you'll achieve what you've always wanted.
Just remember...
Your attitude.
Your determination.
And your mindset...
They play a fundamental role in achieving any goal.
So open up your mind .

...
You know why most people don't take action and never go for what they want in
life?
Because of the ""I can't"".
Whenever it's time for them to make a life-changing decision, the only answer
they have is...
I can't.
Why don't you learn a new skill?
I can't. I don't have time.
Start your own business?
I can't, I don't have money.
It's the only thing they know how to say.
Truth is, they're just too afraid of what might happen.
They usually don't have their skills.
They worry that they're not up to the challenge.
That stress will end up conquering them and making them fail.
So they prefer to do nothing.
And decide to settle for what they have right now.
To stay average.
Looking at how others do get successful and achieve their goals.
But never feeling it themselves.
And feeling horrible about it.
With a bitter taste in the mouth.
For not daring to take the step, regardless of the consequences.
Because they allowed their fears to stop them from pursuing their dreams and
going after what they really want in life.
Without realizing it, they killed all the dreams and aspirations they ever had.
What these people end up discovering later is that they end up living with a
load on their shoulders.
A load of regret.
And it gets worse as time goes on.
You always end up remembering that moment when you had the opportunity to change
your life ...
But you chose not to.
But you know what ?
The fact that you are reading this email tells me that you still have time.
Perhaps you are facing that life-changing decision right now.
But you haven't made that leap because you think you can't.
If that's the case then...
Let me tell you something.
There's one key thing that differentiates successful people from the average.
And that is that...
Successful people never say ""I can't.""
Instead, they ask: ""How can I do it?""
Successful people are willing to do whatever it takes to be successful.
If they fail, they learn from that experience and move on.
Most people don't do that.
They stay in their comfort zone.
Because they're too afraid to fail.
And you can't expect different results if you keep doing the same things over
and over again.
That's why you need to step up and start trying new approaches.
Think of a time when you had to do something you were really scared of...
Something that you were really afraid of.
Maybe giving a speech in front of an audience, or asking someone out on a date.
Now tell me, after you did it...
Did it feel as scary?
In the end, it wasn't as scary and difficult as you thought, was it?
And you learned from that experience.
Start approaching everything in your life in the same way.
If you really want to be successful, you must take action.
Find a way to approach the situation.
Organize your schedule and find the time you need to practice.
Break down your goal into smaller goals.
Sure, it will take longer to get to where you want...
But at least you'll start moving forward.
And once you start changing the ""I can't"" by ""how can I do it?""...
Everything will change for you.
You'll start seeing new windows of opportunity in your life.
And your mind will start finding ways to make them a reality.
Eventually, you'll achieve what you've always wanted.
Just remember...
Your attitude.
Your determination.

You know ...
Most people are just too optimistic about everything these days.
They have this big project in mind.
A big goal they want to accomplish.
Maybe they're thinking about quitting their jobs and going full-on with that
business idea they have.
Or maybe they want to move to another country and start their lives from
scratch.
And there's nothing wrong with that.
The problem is that they've convinced themselves nothing bad will happen.
That it will all be sunshine and rainbows.
That the doors of heaven will open and things will just magically fall onto
their lap.
All they have to do is stay positive.
And nothing bad will happen.
All because a motivational speaker on IG told them to take risks and everything
will be OK.
And if somebody dares to ask them:
""And what if things don't work out?""
They immediately put them on the black list.
They're non-believers.
Pessimists who don't know what it takes to be successful.
After all, there's no need for a plan.
When you have a 99% chance of succeeding.
That's what they think.
Until crisis hits.
As it turns out...
Things were not going to be as easy as we thought.
Problems and challenges start coming from every possible direction.
Obstacles that you don't see how to manage through.
You start feeling like you're losing control.
Panic starts taking over you.
You get worried.
Anxious.
Everything you thought couldn't happen well...
Just did.
And you don't know how to manage that situation.
You're faced with a wall.
And don't have the least idea how you'll climb it.
You started your business thinking you'll work from a beach in Hawaii sipping
Pina Coladas.
But you didn't think you'll have to work 20-Hour days at first to lift it off
the ground.
You started going to the gym to get shredded.
But you were not prepared to give in on that Papa John's pizza you ate every
weekend.
And in the middle of it all...
You end up giving up.
Because you ""didn't think it would be as hard"".
That's why if you really want to make your dreams come true and achieve your
goals...
...then there's something you must start to do.
And that is:
To start planning for the worst, and hoping for the best.
Now, with this, I'm not saying you should build your own private bomb shelter
with canned beans stacked to the ceiling...
This is not a survival reality TV show.
Plus, there's nothing wrong with being positive.
Actually, you need to be if you want to achieve great things in life.
But...
You need to understand that behind every big dream and goal.
There are great challenges and setbacks to overcome.
And you can't ignore them.
Instead, start treating them as a real possibility.
And start planning ahead in case something unexpected happens.
Go through every possible scenario in your head.
If you're planning on quitting your job, ask yourself...
Do you have enough savings to support your family in case things go south?
Have you considered what to do if things don't go according to plan?
Do you have the skills you need to get another job if you need to?
Also, do your research.
Ask other people how their experience was.
Those who've been through something similar and succeeded.
They'll let you know where the bumps on the roads are.
I'm not saying to be paranoid about what might happen.
If you start doing this today ...
You'll never be caught off guard again.
You'll have peace of mind.
Because you'll be prepared for any challenge that comes your way.
Know exactly what to do.
And you'll have the resilience and motivation to overcome any situation.
Keep that in mind.
Always forward,
Simon
P.S. If you want to learn how to create a plan to overcome any challenge and
make things happen in your life then...
I'll be more than happy to help you

17cffc097fc57758,hello@lifehack.org,Leon Ho,utaku0611@gmail.com,utaku0611@gmail.com,Nobody likes getting this ...,"Nov 08, 2021, 18:39:23","Nov 08, 2021, 19:03:04","
Let's face it .
Nobody likes getting feedback from others.
We get defensive.
Uncomfortable.
And shut ourselves down.
Now, we're not talking here about those people that just want to criticize every
step you give.
We're talking about people who genuinely want to see you succeed.
They have the credibility.
They have the skills.
And want to share their knowledge with you.
Just to help you achieve your goals faster.
But even if we know what they're saying to us is right.
Even though the advice they're giving us could potentially 10x the results we're
having...
We refuse to listen.
Defending our arguments and the way we do things.
Insisting that they don't know what they're talking about.
We just don't want to hear what we did wrong or the ways we can improve it.
And we keep on doing things in the same way.
But...
You know what happens when you refuse to take feedback from others ?
You stop learning.
You stop growing.
You stop moving forward in life.
End up making the same mistakes over and over again.
Hitting against the same wall.
Doing things the same way, and expecting a different result.
And the more you try to get yourself out of that situation.
The more you get in.
Until you end up giving up.
All because you didn't want to hear what those by your side had to say.
To accept that your way of doing things was not OK.
Fortunately, there's a way to stop this from happening to you.
And that is...
By removing your emotions out of the equation.
See ...
Most people get offended when they get feedback.
Like the person talking had some sort of personal vendetta against them.
And when you let your emotions get the best of you...
You stop seeing things objectively.
You stop listening.
And because of that, you never learn the lesson.
And apply what's being told to you.
On the other hand,
Because you think you're still right.
Even if you don't completely agree with the giver.
And you'll apply it in your daily life.
You'll seem more approachable.
You'll stop judging the person in front of you.
Instead, you'll point your finger at yourself, and how your actions can improve.
That's why you need to get past the initial negative reactions.
To hear what others have to say about you objectively.
With an open mind.
And the willingness to change.
Once you start doing this ...
Things will change radically for you.
Those areas you've been struggling with for years won't be an issue.
You'll start learning from your mistakes.
You'll listen to the advice others gave you.
And you'll never stop learning new things.
And growing in every area of your life.
Your friend,
Leon

to succeed in life...
